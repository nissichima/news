## Overview

The goal of this project is to give the student practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

In order to develop this project, we are using the concept of Natural language processing and APIs created with the purpose of evaluating Natural language. 

Wikipedia offers the following definition: 

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

The students will use an API called MeaningCloud to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.
